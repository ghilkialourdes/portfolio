During storms police's standing under the trees lost their lives because of trees falling on them. The climate conditions are causing difficulties to their work and lives too.

                    To protect Police cops who stands under sun, in rain and cold weather. To detect the high speeding vehicles from the police cops’ room and to have the light provision according to the sunlight. To have a comfortable temperature around them. Police cops stand under the stand or just under a small roof which is very hot in summer and the water enters during rain, the snow and mist gives a bad condition for the police cops. They just hold onto the umbrella and wears raincoat to make them comfort which reduces the concentration of them. Here we discuss about the existing solutions, financial statements, market analysis and objectives of our project. We have made a cost-efficient smart cop room which should be implemented more in India. We know police cops have difficulty to in work due to weather conditions. Our project motto is to safe guard the police cops who are safe guarding us. This Smart Police Cops’ Room have a comfortable temperature around them. Here we use equipment like temperature sensor to adjust the room temperature according to the weather condition. Then, we have used rain drop sensor to sense arrival of the rain and uses umbrella like roofs which protect the police cops from the rain. We used LDR which is a special type of resistor that works on the principle of photo-conductivity.

                    Internet of Things Enabled Smart Farming [AGROFLORE] is a cross platform application with continuously monitoring of plant’s required soil moisture, temperature, soil’s Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels. The software contains the details of the crops, disease management and green house application, in addition to this the users can add the crops if they are not in the application. The application is designed in the concept of open source where any one can upload data. The additional module is a forecast module of weather which is now works with the help of a application program interface name Weather API, the data regarding the current situation such as wind, Humidity, Wind Direction, Climate, Precipitation, Pressure, Gust and Ultrasonic Radiation are displayed to the user. The user also can know about their thoughts on agriculture and their countries status regarding agriculture in the form of Pie Chart in Home Module. The Future of the farmers can be uplifted if the knowledge of farming is reached worldwide. This application enables the person with no knowledge of agriculture to undertake farming at the level of basics.

                <h5>Motivation</h5>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The motivation for IoT enabled smart farming arises from the increasing demand for food due to the rapid growth of the global population. There has been a need for technological advancements in agriculture, to ensure sustainable and efficient farming practices.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">"Agriculture is the greatest and fundamentally the most important of our industries. The cities are but the branches of the tree of national life, the roots of which go deeply into the land. We all flourish or decline with the farmer." - Bernard Baruch. The traditional farming practices have been hindered by several challenges such as unpredictable weather conditions, soil degradation, pest infestation, and limited water supply. These challenges have led to low yields, low quality crops, and reduced profitability for farmers.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">IoT technology has the potential to transform agriculture by enabling smart farming practices. The integration of IoT technology in farming involves the use of sensors, data analytics, and automation systems to optimize crop production and improve efficiency. IoT enabled smart farming can help to address the challenges faced by traditional farming practices. It enables farmers to monitor soil moisture, nutrient levels, and temperature in real-time, allowing for timely interventions to be made. This technology also enables automated irrigation systems, reducing water waste and ensuring efficient use of resources.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Furthermore, the application of IoT technology in agriculture can enable precision farming practices, where crops and animals are monitored individually to optimize their growth and health. This technology can also help farmers to identify pest infestations and diseases early, enabling prompt interventions to be made.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Overall, the integration of IoT technology in farming can help to improve crop production, reduce resource wastage, and ensure sustainable farming practices.</p>
